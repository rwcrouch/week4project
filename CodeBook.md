Codebook

These are the 66 variables that contain means and standard deviations for means and standard deviations and the activity and subject variables


Variables that begin with:

time-represent a time variable

freq- represent a frequency variable

After this distinction, the type of measurement is abbreviated.  The explanation of these types is explained in the original codebook


At the end of the variable name, there is either the word: mean or std followed by the letter x, y, z or no letter

The word mean indicates a mean, the word std indicates a standard deviation, and x, y and z indicate the direction of the axial signal
